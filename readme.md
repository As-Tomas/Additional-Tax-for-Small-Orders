# Additional Tax for Small Orders

This WooCommerce plugin adds an additional tax fee to the cart if the total cart value is below a specified threshold. It is designed to encourage larger orders by applying a flat tax to smaller orders.

## Description

When the cart subtotal is less than 1000kr, an additional tax of 250kr is automatically added. This plugin helps manage minimum order amounts effectively by encouraging customers to increase their cart value to avoid extra charges. This tax is shown to the customer with a notice each time it is applied, ensuring transparency.

## Features

- **Automatic Tax Addition**: Automatically adds a tax of 250kr to all orders under 1000kr.
- **Dynamic Notices**: Informs the customer via a notice in the cart and checkout whenever the additional tax is applied.
- **Easy to Install**: Quick setup and integrates smoothly with WooCommerce.
